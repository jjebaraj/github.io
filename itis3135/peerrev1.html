            <ol>
                <li>NO SPACES: The spacing on your files is as required and appears to work</li>
                <li>NO UPPER-CASES: I don’t see any uppercase file names</li>
                <li>DON'T UNDERLINE NON-LINKS: There are no underlined links on the site</li>
                <li>MANAGE FILES WELL: The file management overall is satisfactory</li>
                <li>VALIDATE HTML & CSS: The site does not have either of these requirements</li>
                <li>ATTENTION TO DETAIL: The menu is off-center but otherwise no major complaints</li>
                <li>BRAND EVERYTHING: Branding on the first page but that appears to be it </li>
                <li>NLINK TO JS & CSS: There are links to both JS and CSS</li>
                <li>MEANINGFUL REVIEW: Overall the site has a very nice aesthetic and is easy to navigate. Some feedback that I would have is that it the menu ifs off center and very janky looking. Also, the images on the “my clips” section appear to be nonfunctional, essentially making that page useless. The menu dividers are also strange and not consistent but that could also be the general idea that you were going for.</li>
                <li>CLEAN UP IMAGES: The images that work appear to fit nicely on the screen.</li>
                <li>BE CAREFUL ABOUT COPYRIGHT: All pictures are original so there is no need to worry about that. </li>
