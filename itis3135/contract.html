            <h2>Contract</h2>
            <p class = "figure">
                I,Joseph A Jebaraj agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022
                ,ITIS 1315, Web App Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
            <br/>
        <br/>
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world
            , and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
                <br/>
            <br/>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
        As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
             <br/>
            <br/>
             I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible
              to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
             and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit 
             (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            <br/>
        <br/>
