            <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Excellent contrast throughout the page, only changing colors and themes when needing to highlight something</li>
                <li>Repetition: Key themes are reused throught the site, in a clear and aestheic manner</li>
                <li>Alignment: Everything is aligned perfectly and I could not find anything that could use improvement</li>
                <li>Proximity: Everything is easily accessible and grouped accordingly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.demanddriveninstitute.com">Demand Driven Institute (www.demanddriveninstitute.com)</a></h3>
            <p>The company Demand Driven Institute has a model that the company seeks to implement into other businesses</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: This website has so much contrast to the point where it is essentially unusable. The bright yellow,green and red would give most users a migrane</li>
                <li>Repetition: The repetition is so overused that the box icons with colors take over the page</li>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment is overall well done except for the occasional random icon scaterred throughout the screen</li>
                <li>Proximity: There seems to be no pattern for grouping elements </li>
